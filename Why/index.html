  <h1>Why - and why not - SuperBot?</h1>
  <p>There are myriads of Discord bots in the market, some paid, some free and some open source. Here, I'd like to state the 4
    most significant reasons for you to invite SuperBot.</p>
  <h3>Absolutely free with no hosting required</h3>
  <p>Of course, there are bots more specific and focused than SuperBot. However, most are fraught with barriers which force you
  to pay or vote for the bot on platforms in order to gain access to features. Some open source bots do not come with ready-to-use
  bot users. SuperBot neither asks you for money nor require you to do the setup yourself.</p>
  <h3>Informative</h3>
  <p>SuperBot tries to utilize every single function available for the bot. It tries to output whatever the output is, instead of
  truncating it. For instance, instead of saying "Created on 1st January", SuperBot might say "Created at 2021-01-01 12:00".</p>
  <h3>Uniqueness</h3>
  <p>Many commands of SuperBot are unparalleled and cannot be easily found in the market. For instance,<span class="code">=length</span>gives
  you a full length analysis of the text, plus the number of each character. The major alternatives would often just give you
  the total length of the text.</p>
